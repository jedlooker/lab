            <p><strong>London</strong></p><!-- This could also be an <h2> technically -->
            <p>To take nothing from <em>Elementary</em> being set in New York, Sherlock Holmes is a product of London. The crimes and misdemeanors that he and Watson encounter are rooted in British society, British morals, and London’s way of treating those things, from Buckingham Palace to the bins around the back of Speedy’s Cafe. And London is a city that wears its past like a fine coat, so it does not matter at all that <em>Sherlock</em> is set more than a century after Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s original stories. That old and misty London is still very much alive in a world of wifi, sexting and motorized carriages.</p>
